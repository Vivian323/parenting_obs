Investigating the effects of electronically-delivered parenting advice on parent-child interactions. Parents watch videos of activities developed for a parenting app (experimental group) or watch no video (control group) and then interact with their child with a set of props for 3 minutes. Outcome measures are bids for joint attention and episodes of joint attention, and parent language output (word tokens and types and lexical diversity).
