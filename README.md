Does video-scaffolding of parent-child interactions affect the socio-linguistic attributes of the interaction? Parents watch activity-scaffolding videos developed for a parenting app (experimental group) or watch no video (control group; experiment 1) or a video about infant development that does not scaffold the activity (control group; experiment 2). Outcome measures are bids for joint attention and episodes of joint attention, and parent language output (number of word tokens and lexical diversity).
